## Introduction:
In today's digital world, we are constantly bombarded with vast amounts of textual information, making it difficult to extract key insights efficiently. Text Summarization is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that aims to generate concise and meaningful summaries from large bodies of text.

## Why Text Summarization?:
   - Time Efficiency: Helps users quickly grasp essential information.
   - Better Comprehension: Summarized text enhances readability and understanding.
   - Automated Insights: AI-powered summarization reduces manual effort and bias.

## AI-Based Text Summarization:
   Text summarization can be classified into:
   - `Extractive Summarization`: Selects key sentences directly from the original text.
   - `Abstractive Summarization`: Generates new sentences using deep learning techniques, similar to how humans paraphrase.
